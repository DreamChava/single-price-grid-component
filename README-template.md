## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action


### Links

- Live Site URL: (sal-price-grid.netlify.com)

## My process

My process started out with just practicing and trying to use more semantic HTML. Once I had a solid structure I tried to refactor or change things that were unnecessary like trying to add h1 for the price but using Gemini I learned that it isn't good for SEO. Using an H1 is important for internet traffic and wasting it on a price tag is not optimal. Once that was done I started styling my site with flex. It was pretty straight forward and I tried to optimize it to look best for desktop and mobile. I did however run into a problem with my responsive design. I shrinked my local web page that I hosted with live server but my effects weren't happening because it wasn't enough for mobile size. I went on to use Chrome dev tools and then I saw the changes which I was relieved!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Using an H1 is important for internet traffic and wasting it on a price tag is not optimal for SEO.


### Continued development

I want to keep on making beautiful UI and hopefully get to the level of using React.


### AI Collaboration

Describe how you used AI tools (if any) during this project. This helps demonstrate your ability to work effectively with AI assistants.

- What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot)? Gemini

- How did you use them (e.g., debugging, generating boilerplate, brainstorming solutions)? I used them when there was something I needed like remembering about line height property in CSS or what tag to use best for price and making it more semantic.

- What worked well? What didn't? I didn't run into any problems at all since this  was pretty simple practice project.
